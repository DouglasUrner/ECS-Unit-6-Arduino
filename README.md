# ECS-Unit-6-Arduino

An alternative to the ECS Robotics Unit (Unit 6) using an Arduino and the Zumo Bot robot chasis and control board.

## Getting Started

### What to order

### Robot assembly

Notes on things that might not be obviousâ€¦

1. Decide how you want to set the buzzer jumper on the Zumo. Out of the box the jumper isn't connected and the buzzer (sounds) don't work. To enable sounds install jumper between the pins labeled 328P (towards the back of the chasis).

### Software

Initially I'm using the stock Arduino IDE (1.6.3 at this writing). It should be possible to also use Scratch, but that looks like it will take some work.

1. Download the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Depending on your host platform, you may also need to install or update Java.
2. Install the Zumo Bot extensions

I'm going to work on setting it up so that you can also install the "whole ball of wax" by cloning this repository.
